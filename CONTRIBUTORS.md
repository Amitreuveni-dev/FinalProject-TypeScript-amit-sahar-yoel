## Contributor Roles & Responsibilities

### üéÆ Amit Reuveni - Project Lead & UI Developer
**Primary Role**: Project architecture, page structure, UI/UX design
**Commit Pattern**: Regular contributions throughout development

#### Key Contributions:
- Initial project setup and structure
- Created multi-page application structure (login, main, contact, settings)
- Implemented contact form with localStorage
- Styled all pages with SCSS
- Set up basic game container and layout

#### Code Sample - Contact Form Implementation:
```typescript
// src/contact/contact.ts (lines 10-17)
const savedMessages = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("contactMessages") || "[]");

savedMessages.push({
  ...data,
  date: new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10),
});

localStorage.setItem("contactMessages", JSON.stringify(savedMessages));
```

**Assessment**: Shows understanding of localStorage API and data persistence, though lacks error handling.

### üéÆ Yoel - Game Mechanics Developer
**Primary Role**: Core game logic, tank movement, animations
**Commit Pattern**: Focused work on game functionality

#### Key Contributions:
- Implemented Tank class with movement mechanics
- Added acceleration/deceleration system
- Created rotation animations for tank sprites
- Implemented boundary wrapping ("wall feature")
- Two-player control system (WASD + Arrow keys)

#### Code Sample - Tank Movement Logic:
```typescript
// src/main/main.ts (lines 109-114)
// Handle acceleration/deceleration
if (isMoving) {
  this.speed = Math.min(this.speed + this.acceleration, this.maxSpeed);
} else {
  this.speed = Math.max(this.speed - this.deceleration, 0);
}
```

**Assessment**: Good understanding of game physics concepts but lacks abstraction and proper architecture.

### üéÆ Shahar - Authentication Developer
**Primary Role**: Login system implementation
**Commit Pattern**: Minimal contribution (2 commits only)

#### Key Contributions:
- Created login page and authentication logic
- Basic form validation
- Button state management

#### Code Sample - Login Class:
```typescript
// src/login/login.ts (lines 13-15)
checkCredentials():boolean{
  return this.username === this.correctUsername && this.password === this.correctPassword;
}
```

**Assessment**: Very basic implementation with security issues (hardcoded credentials).

## Technical Architecture Analysis

### MVC Implementation Status: ‚ùå Not Achieved
The project attempted to follow MVC but implementation is incomplete:

**Model (Partial)**:
- Tank class exists but mixes concerns
- No clear data models for game state

**View (Mixed)**:
- HTML files for structure
- Rendering logic embedded in model classes

**Controller (Missing)**:
- Logic scattered throughout classes
- No clear controller layer

### Code Quality Metrics

#### TypeScript Usage:
```typescript
// Example of type usage
type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right" | "none";

// But also poor practices:
password: any;  // Should be string
username: any;  // Should be string
```

#### File Organization:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/          ‚úÖ Good: Centralized assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact/         ‚úÖ Good: Feature-based folders
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login/          
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/           
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/        ‚ö†Ô∏è  Bad: Empty implementation
```

## Version Control Analysis

### Commit Message Quality:
- **Good Examples**: 
  - "minor update - wall feature!" (Yoel)
  - "add bullet function" (Amit)
  - "footer position" (Yoel)

- **Poor Examples**:
  - "." (Amit - multiple times)
  - "1" (Yoel - multiple times)
  - "a" (Yoel)

### Branch Usage:
- Main branch: Primary development
- grid-remove branch: Created by Yoel (purpose unclear)
- No feature branch strategy evident

## Code Level Classification

### Amit - Intermediate Level
- Can structure projects and create functional features
- Understands basic TypeScript and modern web development
- Needs improvement in architecture patterns and code organization

### Yoel - Intermediate Level  
- Good grasp of animation and movement mechanics
- Understanding of game development concepts
- Needs to learn proper software architecture

### Shahar - Beginner Level
- Very basic understanding of web development
- Minimal contribution indicates learning phase
- Needs significant improvement in all areas

## Final Assessment

**Project Status**: Incomplete game prototype
**Architecture Goal**: Failed to implement MVC pattern
**Team Collaboration**: Highly imbalanced with one member barely participating
**Code Quality**: Basic to intermediate with room for significant improvement

The project shows promise in individual features but lacks cohesion and completion. The team would benefit from better planning, communication, and equal participation from all members.
